# DATA SOURCE & DATA CLEANING PROCESS
The Adidas dataset was gotten from Kaggle.com. The dataset contains 9648 rows and 11 columns. We  checked for duplicates but there were no duplicates. We  also checked for blank cells but there were no blank cells. In the process of transforming the dataset we created three calculated columns to help us with the analysis. The title of the columns are:
	Total Revenue = Price per Unit Column multiplied by Unit Sold Column
	Total Cost = Cost per Unit Column multiplied by Unit Sold Column 
	Profit = Subtraction of Total Cost Column  from  Total Revenue Column
So in total the dataset has 14 columns and 9648 rows.
