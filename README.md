# DATA SOURCE & DATA CLEANING PROCESS
The Adidas dataset was gotten from Kaggle.com. The dataset contains 9648 rows and 11 columns. We  checked for duplicates but there were no duplicates. We  also checked for blank cells but there were no blank cells. In the process of transforming the dataset we created three calculated columns to help us with the analysis. The title of the columns are:
	Total Revenue = Price per Unit Column multiplied by Unit Sold Column
	Total Cost = Cost per Unit Column multiplied by Unit Sold Column 
	Profit = Subtraction of Total Cost Column  from  Total Revenue Column
So in total the dataset has 14 columns and 9648 rows.

2. It increases steadily through Q2 with $11.9M in profit.
3. It peaks in Q3 at approximately $14.1M, the highest point in the year.
   profit then declines in Q4 to  $11.5M.
   
INSIGHTS

Strong growth occurs from Q1 to Q3, indicating favorable business conditions, successful campaigns, or high customer demand.
Q3 is the peak revenue quarter, suggesting seasonality or concentrated sales activity.
The noticeable drop in Q4 may indicate reduced demand, lower sales activity or budget closures.

# RECOMMANDATIONS

A1. Adidas should continue investing in online sales channels through improved user experience, digital marketing, and fast delivery options.
2. Outlet performance is strong and should be maintained.
3. To boost in-store sales, Adidas can introduce targeted promotions, in-store experiences, and product exclusives to attract more physical shoppers.

B1. Adidas should continue investing in Men’s Footwear, particularly street and athletic segments, as they show strong profit results.
 2. For weaker categories like Women’s Athletic Footwear, Adidas should evaluate marketing strategy, and inventory levels to identify improvement opportunities.
 3. Increasing targeted campaigns for underperforming women’s categories may help balance revenue across product lines.

C1. Focus on what works in the West by examining pricing, product mix, and operational strategies that are driving its strong performance, and replicate these across other regions.
2. Investigate Midwest performance ; 
   Conduct  a market review to identify whether the issue is low demand, poor distribution, or competitive pressure, and design targeted interventions.


D1. Invest more in  top retailers (west gear, foot locker, sports direct)
2.  Improve visibility and promotions on underperforming platforms

 
E1.  Investigate Q4 decline: analyze sales channels, customer activity, and market conditions to identify causes and prevent similar drops in future cycles.

 2.  Leverage Q3 success: identify the strategies that drove the Q3 peak (promotions, product launches, seasonal demand) and consider extending or replicating them in Q4.
 
 3.  Strengthen Q1 performance by launching early-year promotions or pipeline-building strategies to avoid a slow start.
